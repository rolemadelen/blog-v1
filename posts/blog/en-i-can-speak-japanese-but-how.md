![ご飯](/images/posts/journal/japanese/work.jpg)

I'm currently working in Japan as a frontend developer in a startup based in Minatomirai.
I also work(?) as an _interpreter_ and translate English<->Japanese for developers who don't speak the language.

It was just another day. I had my meetings and interpreted words from here to there and vice versa.

When the meeting was over, my fellow co-worker DM'd me and asked couple questions about my Japanese.

Let's go over it one by one.

## How did I remember all kanjis?

Well, I didn't 😬 and I'm not even gonna try to remember all; that's merely impossible with my brain.

Also, I can barely write any kanji characters. Some easy kanjis like `口` (_kuchi_), `石` (_ishi_), `右` (_migi_), or `左` (_hidari_) are all I can write really (maybe more 🤷🏻‍♂️).

Although I can't write kanjis, I can read them. This is only because I've seen it so many times throughout my times in Japan. I wouldn't be able to remeber and write`作業` (_sagyou_; work or task), but I know how it looks like and how it's pronounced.

This is probably the reason why my co-worker thought I remembered all kanjis but again, no. I just familiarized myself with shapes and pronounciation of frequently used Japanese words. That's all.

## Have I took JLPT exam?

No, I never took JLPT exam. I never thought I needed one to get a job in Japan and indeed I didn't need one.

Having one line in your resume about JLPT doesn't prove anything about your ability to communicate in Japanese.

You can show your Japanese during an interview and they'll determine that your Japanese is either enough or not enough to work. Isn't that what interview is for?

## Okay but did you study JLPT?

No.

## How did you study Japanese?

I was exposed to Japanese at an early age because one of my family member was a huge fan of Japanese boy band. We only had one computer back then and we shared using it by alternating every two hours. Whenever the familly member was watching a Japanese TV show, anime, or comedy show, I was there watching it together.

From these, I picked up a listening skill and was able to hear Japanese although I didn't know what any of them meant. What I mean by this is that, if somebody says 'ころす', I can hear these three _kana_, 'こ', 'ろ', 'す' and look up the word by myself.

I've continued watching and reading Japanese contents until I got into the uni. My current stat at this point is that I can understand 85\~90% of the daily conversation but I can't speak any because I don't know how to form a sentence.

I took one course of Japanese 101 (_First Year Japanese I_). I learned basic form of a sentence and conjugation of verbs like:

- `食べる` - verb 'to eat'
- `食べた` - I ate
- `食べたい` - I want to eat
- `食べたくない` - I don't want to eat
- `食べてない` - I haven't ate
- `食べれない` - I can't eat
- `食べない` - I don't eat
- and more …

It was this moment that I started speaking Japanese although it took some time to form a sentence. I started using all those phrases that I was familar with from watching anime and tv series. I was able to switch up verbs in a sentence and make my own snetnce because I now knew those rules of conjugating.

Since I can hear Japanese, it was easier for me to pick up new words and phrases.

That's about it. So here's a recap of my Japanese learning(?) journey.

- _Listening_ - I've watched and listened to bunch of Japanese contents at an early age.
- _Speaking_ - I took one course of Japanese at a uni and learned a basic grammar.
- _Writing_ - I can't write an essay in formal manner, but I can write as if I'm speaking to my co-worker.
