How many monitors do you own?

I used to have two separate monitors connected to my mac: a curved 32" monitor and 27" monitor in vertical. But recently, I felt like these are taking up too much space. Do I really need these monitors? Can I replace these monitors with something smaller?

I did some research and I came across with [Immersed](https://immersed.com/) in VR.

It's basically a workspace in VR with 5 extra monitors max (default 3 monitors and 2 extra after buying the subscription).

Before I get myself into this though, I wanted to see whether this is actually do-able or not. Because, I've seen people _trying_ to code using VR but those resolutions looked terrible and disgusting.

I spent so much time on digging through reddit posts and even twitter to see whether this thing is legit or not.

Then, I found one guy in twitter who's been coding using Immersed for about a year. I DM this person and asked whether he's still using VR to code or not and if not, why stopped using it.

He said he's still coding in VR. He uses a pomodoro technique where he works for 30 minutes and rest for 10 minutes and repeat the cycle. This way he can reduce tho stress on his head and neck for wearing the gear for too long. Everything was good for him.

I never used VR before, but I thought it'd be a good experience to try it. If it doesn't work out, I can just have fun with VR.

So I bought Meta Quest 2 and immersed. And here's what my working space is like:

I bought the subscription so I have an access to all 5 monitors but only using 4 for now.

At first, it was like a trial and error. I had to adjust the monitor size and position like endlessly but eventually I got it and it's mind-blowing.

Despite all those negative reviews about bad resolution, hard to read, etc.. I can read clearly. It's more than doable.

I do have a feeling that my eyes and neck is gonna get super tired. So, I decided to use pomodoro technique as well just like the other guy from twitter.

I use this app called [flow](https://flowapp.info/) which is basically a pomodoro timer; you see it on that gif, bottom-left. I work for 30 minutes in VR and take off the gear to rest for 10 minutes. I do 4 rounds of this and then take 15 minutes long break and back to the cycle again.
