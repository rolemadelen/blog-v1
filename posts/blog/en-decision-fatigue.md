_[clock hits 4:30 AM]_

_Beep beep beep_. My watch starts ringing and vibrating on my wrist.

_["ugh. should I wake up now? maybe 5 more minutes?"]_

I stayed in the bed for about ~~50~~ 5 minutes and got up, and I headed to the bathroom.

_["should I wash my face first or brush teeth first? wth. just pick one and do it."]_

As I brush my teeth, I went to the kitchen and got my thermo pot ready for my morning hot tea.
I continue to think over _what tea I should get_ as I finish brushing my teeth and as I wash my face.

I ended up getting a darjeeling tea -- not my favorite, but need to finish it.

I'm back to my room.

I sat on a swivel chair and opened my laptop.

_["What should I do this morning?"]_

🤷🏻‍♂️

Life is all about making decisions.

When your morning alarm hits, you decide whether to hit that snooze button or not. You spend time thinking about your meals. You goto grocery and wonder around because you don't know what you really want - _should I get this for my lunch? for dinner?_. You also spend time in front of your wardrobe - _what should I wear today?_ And it goes on and on...

But are all decisions same in terms of how important they are? Is a decision about '_what I should have as a breakfast_' equally important as '_should I goto college_'? Probabbly not.

This _thing_ that I'm trying to decide could be very tiny that nobody cares or it could be a massive one that can have a huge impact on my life.

There's nothing I can do about such important decisions because I'd sleep on it too to make a better decision for my life. But tiny one that not-so-important..🤔

If it's not that important, why should I spend so much time on it?

> "I'm spending too much time pondering about breakfast"

I realized that I can just have same breakfast everyday, then I don't need to spend time thinking about what to eat.

So I did.

I've been eating cheese and egg toast for about a month now and it definitely helped me saving some time. I stopped wondering around the kitchen. I stopped re-opening and closing the fridge meaninglessly.

Now when the clock hits 6:00 AM, I goto the kitchen and open the fridge, grab a bread, an egg, two slices of cheese, and my breakfast is ready to go.

I also spent far less time on grocery because I know exactly what I need. Assuming that no people are lining up at a register, I can get my business done in less than 5 minutes.

> "I'm spending too much time in front of my wardrobe"

Go open your closet now and see how much clothes you own. Do you wear all of them? Do you remember when was the last time you wore each clothes? Are any of them too old or is it new that you haven't even got rid of the tag (and still like years old)?

I have lots of clothes that I don't wear and it's still hanging in my wardrobe. I try them on but not really my fit (_why the hell did you bought it then 🙄_) so I put it back to the wardrobe and reach for clothes that I normally wear.

If my wardrobe only had clothes that I actually wear daily, I wouldn't need to go through this process of trying it on and putting it back over and over.

[The Pareto Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp) or 80/20 rule states that roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. I thought about this principle and began to realize that I can apply this rule to my clothes.

I kept about 20% of clothes that I frequently wear and stored rest 80% out of sight.

All these clothes are in 80% category and I'll get rid of them eventually.

Now I own about 30 clothes total. I don't know if it's still too much but it's including all tops, bottoms, and outers. When I open my closet, I can literally grab any pairs of top and bottom and I know I'll like it -- one reason for that is because my wardrobe is monochromatic; as I reduced number of clothes, I reduced color choices as well.

I still think I have too many tops that I want to reduce it down to less than 5 shirts 🤔
