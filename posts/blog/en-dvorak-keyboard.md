What is a Dvorak keyboard?

> Dvorak is a keyboard layout for English patented in 1936 by August Dvorak and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, as a faster and more ergonomic alternative to the QWERTY layout - Wikipedia

QWERTY Keyboard Layout

If you ever used typewriters before, you actually can't type it too fast; otherwise the mechanical parts will get stuck. And QWERTY layout was made to handle the slow movement of typewriters _legs_. In other words, it was designed in a way that people can't type it too fast.

On the other hand, the Dvorak keyboard was designed for typists. Vowels and commonly used consonants are positioned at the home row on the left and right side, respectively. This design puts 70 percent of all English keystrokes at the home row. With QWERTY? only 32 percent.

Here's a heat map of commonly used keystrokes done in QWERTY and Dvorak.

I've been using the Dvorak layout for about 8 years now, so I'm quite (or very) biased but I think dvorak is much more efficient and productive and does less stress on your wrist.

The reason why I actually switched from QWERTY was because I had wrist pain. I can't say it for sure that the QWERTY was the issue; however, I did felt less and less pain in my wrists ever since I started using the new keyboard layout. Now, the pain is all gone.

Can I still type in QWERTY? Not as fast as dvorak, but yes.
