I once drew a simple ghost-ish character for my friend and it ended up being a profile pic of that friend.

![follower](/images/posts/ghostvatar/follower.jpg)

This made me thought, 'oh maybe I should make an avatar creator with this character?'

So I did.

I named it **Ghostvatar** because it's a ghost + avatar = ghostvatar ðŸ˜€

## Specification (bare minimum)

- one default body of a ghost
- able to change...
  - eyes
  - mouth
  - hand
- able to save it to your machine

## Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS (SASS)
- Vanilla JS
  - I kinda want to use React later for practice but might be an overkill... or is it not? ðŸ¤¨
- do I need database? I'm not sure how I should deal with images. For now I'll just save it locally.
- pnpm
