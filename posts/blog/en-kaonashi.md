_Kao (顔)_ means 'face' and _nashi (無し)_ means 'nothing'. So Kaonash means faceless.

If you're a fan of [Spirited Away (千と千尋の神隠し)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away), this term might be familiar to you because there's a faceless ghost whose name is _Kaonashi_.

I didn't meant to talk about this animation nor characters. Let's focus on the term Kaonashi.

So why am I talking about Kaonashi? When you look at my drawings, you'll notice two things.

Did you notice it? All of them are either facing backward or wearing something on its head. So you don't see their faces; perhaps, they're Kaonashis -- I mean they actually do have faces but I think you get the idea.

The only reason why I'm drawing characters in this way is because... I can't draw faces 😅

I wanted to come up with my own character but the face was always the issue. I felt like I never get better at it.

One day I thought, "lets just draw the body first and do the head later". So I did.

I finished the body. And like always, I didn't know what to do with the head. So I put my pen down and reached my hand over the table to grab a coffee in a cup. At that point, I don't know why but that cup looked like a head to me.

I used that same cup as a head and drew this. My first kaonashi character.

I loved it. It's simple and somewhat unique.

Now, a cup is like a must thing in my drawing that I cannot let it go 😅
