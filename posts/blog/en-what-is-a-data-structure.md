# Data Structures
A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.

More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Types of Data Structure
There are two different types of data structures: **Linear Data Structure** and **Non-Linear Data Structure**.

### Linear Data Structure
In linear data structure, elements are arrange in sequence one after the other.

Examples of linear data structures are:
- Arrays
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked Lists

### Non-Linear Data Structure
Elements in non-linear data structures are not stored in any sequence. They are arranged in hierarchical manner where one element is connected to one or more elements.

Examples of non-linear data structures are:
- Trees
- Graphs
