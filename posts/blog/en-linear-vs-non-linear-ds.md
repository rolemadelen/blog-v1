What are the differences between Linear and Non-Linear data structures?

# Linear Data Structure

- Data items are arranged in sequential order one after the other.
- Items are present on the single layer.
- We can traverse and visit all items on a single run.
- Memory utilization is not efficient because we need to pre-allocate a block of memory.

# Non-Linear Data Structure

- Data items are arranged in non-sequential order.
- Items are present at different layers in hierarchical manner.
- We cannot visit all items in a single run. It requires multiple runs to go through all layers.
- Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways.
