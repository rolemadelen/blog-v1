# Asymptotic Analysis
Asymptotic analysis "is the study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size". In other words, it is a method to compute and measure the running-time of an algorithm.

Asymptotic notations are used to describe the computed running-time or complexity of an algorithm.

# Asymptotic Notations
Asymptotic notations are mathematical notations used to describe the complexity of an algorithm. 

There are mainly three different notations to describe three different states of complexity:
- Theta (Θ) Notation (*a*)
- Big-O Notation (*b*)
- Omega (Ω) Notation (*c*)

## Big-O Notation
Big-O notation describes the upper-bound or **worst-time** complexity of an algorithm.

## Omega Notation
Omega notation describes the lower-bound or **best-time** complexity of an algorithm.

## Theta Notation
Theta notation describes both the lower and upper-bound of an algorithm. It represents the **average-time** complexity of the algorithm.
