## Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

## Characteristics of an Algorithm

If an algorithm meets all of the following requirement, it is considered to be a good algorithm:

1. **Input** and **output** is well-defined.
2. Each step of the algorithm is clear and unambiguous (**Definiteness**).
3. All the steps in the algorithm are necessary with no redundant steps (**Effectiveness**).
4. There exists a base case to terminate the algorithm after definite number of steps (**Finiteness**).
5. The steps of the algorithm should be written in human-readable language. That is, no computer code should exist to explain the steps (**Independent**).
