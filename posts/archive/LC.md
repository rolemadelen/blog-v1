Here's my current workspace setup.

-   [31.5" AOC Curved Gaming Monitor](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07KSNSFLB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
-   [23.6" AOC Curved Gaming Monitor](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07KSDKWCC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
-   M1 MacBook Air 2020
-   Magic Trackpad White
-   HHKB Professional Classic Black

I operate my mac in a clamshell mode so it stays shut on a stand on the side of a desk. 32-inch monitor is positioned horizontally at the center and the smaller one is placed vertically to the left of the larger one.

I've been using this setup for about 2 years and I was pretty satisfied with it. Recently though, I started feeling unsure about owning multiple monitors.

_"Do I really need these monitors taking up most of the space? **Wouldn't it be nice if I can let these montiors float in mid-air?"**_

At this moment I thought about a _Virtual Reality_. I remember reading an article (or it might be a blog post) about people working in virtual reality. If this works out, maybe I can replace all my monitors with a VR headset.

After a bit of research, I found two promising VR apps that allows you to project your laptop screen into VR. One is [_VR Desktop_](https://www.vrdesktop.net/) and another one is called [_Immersed VR_](https://immersed.com/).

Among the two, I decided to go with Immersed VR only because it gave you three default monitors to start with and additional two screens when I buy the subscription. VR Desktop seemed like it only projects your screen to VR; nothing more, nothing less.

And for the VR headset, Oculus Quest 2 seems goes well with the app immersed so I'm gonna go with Oculust Quest 2 or [Meta Quest 2](https://www.meta.com/jp/en/quest/products/quest-2/) I should say.

I've decided what I'm going to experiment with. But before I open my wallet, I wanted to check whether this is actually doable or not.

Can I actually do my work or code using VR? Is it readable? Any sort of motion sickness? Is it going to affect my lasik-operated eyes?

I've spent some time reading reviewes from people who tried working/coding with VR. Their were lots of pros and cons, but this [post](https://medium.com/immersedteam/working-from-orbit-39bf95a6d385) and a [tweet](https://twitter.com/hmartapp/status/1444891624538996740?s=20) pushed my mind towards buying VR headset and Immersed.

I bought Meta Quest 2 and Immersed and here's a short clip of what my current working space is like.

_'the resolution sucks!'_

Well this clip is a poor illutstration of what I actually see. The resolution sucks indeed but it lacks depth and scale as well.

The _real_ experience is far from what you can imagine from looking at an image or a clip. It's **comfortable**.

I can resize screens, change screen resolution, re-position them however I want, make the screen vertical or horizontal, and I have five screens to work with. I can watch, read, and code perfectly fine.

I've been using this setup for about a month now and I'm happy with what I have so far.

To reduce any sort of stress on my eyes and neck, I use [pomodoro technique](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) while I'm working with VR. I put it on for 30 minutes, then I take a break for 10 minutes. After 4 rounds of pomodoro, I take 20 minutes long break and repeat 30/10 again.

I haven't heard that VR is causing any damage to our eyes but I've done lasik surgery and want to be careful as much as I can. Also pomodoro is actually a productive way to get my work done so it's a win-win to me.
