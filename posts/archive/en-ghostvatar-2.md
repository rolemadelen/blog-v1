**Ghostvatar** is a simple avatar maker for your profile picture.

Zero work on UI for now, but this is generally what the whole project is about: decorate and save.

## Changing parts

For each parts (eyes, mouth, hands, etc...), I used my iPad to draw each one of them and saved it locally.
There must be better ways to store images but I'll update it later.

As you can see, all images share same file names except for the numerical value at the end.
I simply incremented or decremented that value as the user presses `Next` or `Prev` button, and re-assigned the `src` in the image tag.

```js
let eye = 1;
const EYE_MAX = 6;

function switchPrevEye() {
    const eyeImg = document.querySelector('.ghost-eye__img');
    eye -= 1;
    if (eye <= 0) eye = EYE_MAX;
    eyeImg.src = `./assets/eyes/ghost-eye${eye}.png`;
}

function switchNextEye() {
    const eyeImg = document.querySelector('.ghost-eye__img');
    eye += 1;
    if (eye > EYE_MAX) eye = 1;
    eyeImg.src = `./assets/eyes/ghost-eye${eye}.png`;
}
```

_â€œWait, does re-assigning cause the web to re-fetch the image even though it's cached? ðŸ¤” It shouldn't.. it's cached so .. no right? As I'm writing this post, I'm thinking that maybe it's better just to load all the images first and just toggle `display: none` instead of re-assigning the image source... hmm anyway. I'll think about it after I finish writing this post.â€œ_

## Save it

I wasn't sure how to save my ghosts.

Thanks to stackoverflow, I learned about this library [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/).

```js
function saveImage() {
    html2canvas(document.querySelector('.preview'), { scale: 4 }).then(
        (canvas) => {
            let canvasUrl = canvas.toDataURL();
            // Create an anchor, and set the href value to our data URL
            const createEl = document.createElement('a');
            createEl.href = canvasUrl;

            // This is the name of our downloaded file
            createEl.download = 'ghostvatar';

            // Click the download button, causing a download, and then remove it
            createEl.click();
            createEl.remove();
        }
    );
}
```

One issue though. Downloaded image using `html2canvas` was a bit blurry.

I had to set `scale` to get better quality.

```js
  html2canvas(document.querySelector(".preview"),{scale:4}).then(...);
```
